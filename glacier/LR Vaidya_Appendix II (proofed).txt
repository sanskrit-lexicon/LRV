------------------------------------
अक्रूर
--Son of Śvaphalka and Gandhinī, who took possession of the celebrated <i>Śyamantaka</i> jewel from Śatadhanvan when the latter was pursued by Kṛishṇa. When Kṛishṇa discovered that the precious jewel was in Akrūra’s possession, he desired him to retain it. Akrūra then wore it publicly. It was he who conveyed Kṛishṇa and Balarāma to Mathurā where Kṛishṇa performed some of his great exploits.

अगस्त्य
--A great sage said to have been born of Mitrā and Varuṇa in a water-jar (hence called कुम्भोद्भव, कुम्भयोनि). He is regarded as the pioneer of Āryan civilization in the South. Rāma who was his guest for some time was treated by him with the most distinguished tokens of respect and was presented with the bow of Vishṇu, two inexhaustible quivers and a superb coat of mail which had been given to the sage by Indra. The Vindhya mountain once grew jealous and demanded that the sun should revolve round him. This the sun declining to do, the Vindhya elevated himself higher and higher in order to obstruct the passage of the sun and the moon. The gods, alarmed, sought the aid of Agastya. The latter approached the mountain and requested him to lend down and afford him passage to the south, begging at the same time that the mountain would retain a low position till his return. This the mountain promised to do, but Agastya never returned and the Vindhya never attained the height of Himālaya. Agastya is known for having drunk the whole sea and for having eaten up and digested two demons of the names of आतापि and वातापि; owing to the latter incident his name is believed to have a digesting effect on the stomach. He is considered as the regent of the star <i>Canopus</i> in the south, and it is believed that his appearance in the sky makes turbid waters clear, (/R./iv.21, xiii.36).

He was secretly conveyed during night to Ushā’s room, which was rigidly sentinelled, by the magical power of Chitralekhā, friend of Ushā. After a time, he was detected and reported to Bāṇa. A fierce fight ensued between Bāṇa and him. But he proved invincible. Bāṇa, foiled in his attempt of subduing him with arms, contrived his capture by means of his magical faculties. Aniruddha was freed from his captivity by Kṛishṇa who utterly defeated Bāṇa and humbled him down.

On the thirteenth day of the war, he was, owing to the absence of Arjuna, commanded by Yudhishṭhira to charge the Kauravas who were drawn up in the form of a spider’s web; he drove his chariot into the enemies’ ranks and performed prodigies of valour, but was finally conquered by six warriors and slain, (/Ve./ii.).

अंबा
--The eldest daughter of Kāsīrāja. She along with her two sisters was won by Bhīshma as prize in the contest which took place at the time of her <i>Svayamvara</i>. Ambā with her sisters was to be married to Vichitravīrya, the step-brother of Bhīshma; but she refused to marry him saying that she had already taken in her mind king Śālva for her lord. She was allowed to go to Śālva; but on suing him she found to her utter disappointment that her suit was rejected by that prince. Thus repulsed she returned to Bhīshma and importuned him to espouse her, but he would not do so for fear of violating the vow of life-long continence to which he had strictly sworn before his father. She then returned into a forest for observing penance. There one day she fell in with her grand-father who pitied her condition, and taking her to his friend Paraśurāma, requested him to persuade Bhīshma to marry her. Paraśurāma closed with the proposal and took her to Bhīshma but found him untractable. Then followed a trial by combat between the two warriors, but there was no decision. In her helplessness Ambā propitiated Śiva and begged him to furnish her with the means of killing Bhīshma. But this was not possible in that very birth, and the god said that she could have her revenge in her second birth which would be that of a daughter of king Drupada named Śikhanḍinī. Consoled by this promise she quitted the world, was again born as the daughter of Drupada and afterwards became Arjuna’s instrument of killing Bhīshma. See शिखंडिन्.

अम्बिका, अम्बालिका
--Younger sisters of Ambā. They (both of them) were married to Vichitravīrya, but he died before either of them had borne any child to him. Witnessing this utter failure of issue in them, Satyavatī, their mother-in-law, summoned Vyāsa, her eldest son, from the forest who, at her request, begot Dhṛitarāshṭra and Pānḍu respectively on Ambikā and Ambālikā.

अरुन्धती
--Daughter of Kardama and wife of Vasishṭha. “One of the Pleiades and generally regarded as the model of wifely excellence.” Hence the star of this name, which is close to the middle one in the tail of <i>Ursa Major</i>, is pointed out by the bridegroom to his bride, with admonitions to pay obeisance to it, at the marriage ceremony.

अर्जुन
--The third son of Pānḍu and Kuntī, begotten on the latter by Indra. Arjuna was the most favourite pupil of Droṇa. At the <i>Svayamvara</i> of Draupadī, he succeeded in hitting the golden fish and won Draupadī who became the wife of the five brothers. There was a rule among the brothers that if any one of them entered the house of another brother while Draupadī was dwelling there, he should go into exile for twelve years. Arjuna happened to break this rule and had to go into exile in consequence. While thus wandering abroad, he married Ulūpī, Chitrāngadā and Subhadrā. In the course of the exile of the Pānḍavas, Arjuna secured the Pāśupata missile from Śiva with whom, disguised as a Kirāta, he had a severe fight. He was the bravest of the Pānḍavas and the central figure of attraction in the great war with the Kauravas. He killed two of the greatest warriors on the other side, Bhīshma and Karṇa. His next adventures were in connection with the horse-sacrifice performed by Yudhishṭhira. After the massacre at Prabhāsa, he with the other Pānḍavas perished on the Himālaya mountain.

अश्वत्थामन्
--The only son of Droṇa, the military preceptor of the Kauravas and Pānḍavas, and Kṛipī, the sister Kṛipa. He is said to be deathless. In the course of the great war between the Kauravas and the Pānḍavas, one day an elephant, named Aśvatthāman, was slain and the Pānḍavas, by the advice of Kṛishṇa, took advantage of this coincidence in name and falsely reported that Droṇa’s son was dead. Yudhishṭhira was appealed to as being truthful and had to give an evasive reply. Overcome with sorrow at the early death of his only son, the kind old father was for a time insensible. Meanwhile Dhṛishṭadyumna, his avowed enemy, severed his head from the body, (/Ve./iii.). Of all this, Aśvatthāman had no knowledge till the treacherous deed was accomplished. When he heard of it, he was overcome with filial tenderness and in a fit of paroxism upbraided for their pusillanimity all the warriors of his side who witnessed with indifference his father’s death. Aśvatthāman afterwards took his revenge by murdering the five sons of Draupadī, while asleep, and also Dṛishṭadyumna and is believed to be still living, being a चिरंजीविन्.

अश्विनीकुमार
--The twin sons of the sun by his wife संज्ञा in the form of a mare. Once it happened that संज्ञा wanted to go to her father’s house; but her husband would not allow her to go. Through her magical power, she then created a woman, an exact likeness of herself, and substituting her in her place without her husband’s knowledge, went to her father. The sun refused to admit her when she returned. Thus repulsed she assumed the form of a mare, and wandered over the earth. After some time by some domestic discord, the sun came to know all this, assumed the form of a horse and was with his wife, now a mare, who bore to him these twins. The Aśvins are famous as heavenly physicians.

इन्द्र
--The king of heaven and lord of the gods. It is supposed that any body, a god, a man, or a giant, can raise himself to the position of Indra by performing a hundred horse-sacrifices. Indra is, therefore, represented as being jealous of one who performs one hundred sacrifices and as trying to dissuade him from his object either personally or by the intervention of the nymphs of his court, (/R./iii.). He is known as the paramour of Ahalyā, the wife of Gautama, whom he once ravished. Gautama’s curse on this account produced hundreds of sores in the body of Indra but these were afterwards changed into so many eyes (सहस्रनेत्र). He is described to have stolen the horse consecrated by king Sagara, who was about to perform the horse-sacrifice for the hundredth time. He is said to have killed Vṛitra and Bala.

She abode with him for a while and at the expiration of her curse again went to heaven. The king mourned her loss heavily and had the good fortune of seeing his heavenly bride once more. She bore a son to Purūravas before she left him. (The account in the Vikramorvaśīya varies.) See पुरूरवस्.

उलूपी

But the seventh and the eighth, Balarāma and Kṛishṇa, escaped his circumspection. He was warned before the birth of Kṛishṇa that the latter would take his life. He accordingly attempted to kill Kṛishṇa as soon as he was born.

Taking advantage of this, Indra asked from him his impenetrable celestial panoply and ear-rings in the guise of a Brāhmaṇa. Karṇa went to Paraśurāma and, simulating himself a Brāhmaṇa, learnt from him the military art. But once while Paraśurāma was sleeping with his head on Karṇa’s lap, a worm made its way into it and as Karṇa put up with it patiently, he was discovered and cursed that his art would not be useful to him in war.

Thence it was swallowed by the six Kṛittikās, every one of whom, produced a male child.

In course of time, however, Nala in an inauspicious hour, was induced to play at dice with his brother Pushkara and staked every thing except his wife and himself.

They then lived at Indraprastha where they celebrated the Rājasūya sacrifice with great splendour.

After the expiration of the stated period the hostilities were renewed and the great <i>Bhāratī</i> war which lasted for eighteen days and ended in the thorough extermination of the Kauravas was fought.

--The second of the five sons of Pānḍu begotten on Kuntī by Vayu. He was famous for his strength and swiftness and for the unfailing use of his club. The principal events of his life are his conquest of Jarāsandha, the fearful vow uttered by him against Duryodhana and Duhśāsana, his pursuit of Jayadratha after the abduction of Draupadī, hb engagement as head cook in the house of king Virāṭa, the enormous quantity of food which he daily consumed, his contest with Kīchaka, and his killing Duryodhana and his brothers in the great war. He died with the other Pānḍavas on the Himālaya. His name is applied to a person who is strong and dauntless.

भीष्म
--Son of Śantanu and the river Ganges and grand-uncle of the Pānḍavas and Kauravas. His father in his old age desired to marry a young and beautiful damsel, but her parents refused to give her to him, on the ground that her sons would not succeed to the throne, Bhīshma being the rightful heir. In order to please his father, Bhīshma made a vow to the parents of the damsel that he would never accept the kingdom or marry a wife or become the father of children by any woman. His name is traced to this “terrible vow.” Bhīshma, henceforth, became the patriarch of the family and is represented as a model of faithfulness and loyalty. He installed his brother Vichitravīrya on the throne, got him married (See अंबा) and brought up his sons and grand-sons.

He first went to Śiva, and not getting an interview, cursed him to take the form of a <i>Linga</i>. He next went to Brahman (m.), but being received with great indifference, declared that the deity should receive no worship or offerings. Lastly he went to Vishṇu but finding him asleep kicked him on the breast. Instead of being offended, Vishṇu pressed his feet gently and declared himself honoured by the treatment. Bhṛigu consequently declared him to be the only deity entitled to the worship of gods and men.

He married Devayānī, daughter of Śukra and subsequently Śarmishṭhā, the daughter of Vṛishaparvan, who was ordered by her father to attend on Devayānī as a servant for the offence she had given to the latter. (See देवयानी). Through the curse of Śukra, Yayāti became old and infirm before his time, but having appeased his father-in-law he obtained permission to transfer his decrepitude to any one who would consent to take it. Out of his five sons, Puru respectfully complied with his father’s desire. The king, now endowed with renovated youth, passed this time in the enjoyment of pleasures. A thousand years passed in this way, and still he could conceive no end to his desires. The more they were gratified, the more ardent they became. Seeing this, the king suddenly renounced all sensual enjoyment and fixed his mind upon spiritual truth. He restored his youth to Puru, resumed his own decrepitude and departed to the wood of penance.

यशोदा

युधिष्ठिर
--The eldest Pānḍava prince begotten on Kuntī by Dharma (यम). He was more distinguished for piety and truthfulness than for military exploits. Dhṛitarāshṭra installed him king at Vāraṇāvata to avoid the jealousy of his sons. At this place, an attempt was made to burn him and his brothers alive; but they escaped and removed to Indraprastha. Here the Pānḍavas established their supremacy and performed the Rājasūya sacrifice. This excited the jealousy of Duryodhana who arranged for Dharma’s visit to a gambling match at Hastināpura. Through the treacherous contrivances of Duryodhana and Śakuni, Dharma lost every thing and had to go into exile with his wife and brothers. After thirteen years of great trouble, the Pānḍavas opened negotiations for the partition of the kingdom, and being unsuccessful undertook the great <i>Bhāratī</i> war. After eighteen days of severe fighting, in the course of which the Kauravas were all slain, Yudhishṭhira was crowned emperor of Hastināpura and reigned justly and wisely for many years.

राम
--Son of Daśaratha by Kausalyā, the hero of the great epic Rāmāyaṇa.

The old king was shocked at this unexpected request and tried his best to dissuade his wife from her evil intentions, but she proved inexorable. At last Rāma, to fulfil the word of his father, willingly went into exile accompanied by his young and beautiful wife Sītā and his brother Lakshmaṇa. While in forest, Sītā was carried off by Rāvaṇa, king of Lankā. Rāma, assisted by numerous monkeys, built a bridge across the ocean, conquered Lankā, slew Rāvaṇa and recovered his wife. At the expiration of the stated period of exile, he returned to Ayodhya and reigned for a longtime, justly, happily and peacefully. He is believed to be the seventh incarnation of Vishṇu.

रावण
--A celebrated demon, king of Lankā who recovered that city from his half-brother Kuvera and peopled it with his own relations, the <i>Rākshasas</i>. (See विश्रवस् and माल्यवत्). He had ten heads and twenty arms (and also four legs in infancy, /R./xii.88) and had the power of assuming any form at will. In his attempt to propitiate Brahman (n.), he is said to have cut off all his heads but one, when the deity was pleased. He was the most powerful king of his day. Even the gods yielded to his power and were almost enslaved by him. He once attempted to uproot the Kailasa mountain, but Śiva pressed it down and crushed the demon’s hands under it; from this calamity he was relieved only by propitiating that deity. His character is described as libidinous and cruel. In consequence of his having abducted Sītā, Rāma invaded Lankā and killed him in fight.

राहु
--A demon, son of Viprachitti and Sinhikā. When Amṛita was being served to gods, he attempted to partake of it; but the sun and the moon detected him and Vishṇu cut off his head.

In astronomy, Rahu and Ketu are regarded as names for the ascending and descending nodes.

At this announcement, Nārada who happened to be present told her and her father that she would choose grief and misery in choosing Satyavat, as he was fated to die in a year counting from that day. But the high-souled maiden could on no account be put off her purpose and in due time the young couple were married. Sāvitrī put aside her jewels and wore the coarse raiment of hermits.//“Sadly, sadly as she counted, day by day flew swiftly by, //“And the fated time came nearer when her Satyavān must die,//“Yet three days and he must perish, sadly thought the loving wife,//“And she vowed to fast, unresting, for his last three days of life.”//She maintained her fast and on the third day, when her husband went out to perform his daily task of felling trees, she accompanied him. Fatigued by work Satyavat rested his head upon his wife’s breast and fell asleep. In the meantime Yama deprived him of his soul in the presence of Sāvitrī and moved towards the south. Sāvitrī closely followed him and could not be induced to return without Satyavat. At length, love conquered death and Yama, relenting, restored to her her husband’s spirit.
